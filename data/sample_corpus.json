  "sections": [
    "## Project Alpha — Core Features\nBuilt the main dashboard with real-time metrics display. Used React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The spatial navigation component handles drill-down into nested data hierarchies. Committed initial prototype.",
    "## Infrastructure Setup\nVPS running Ubuntu 22.04, 4GB RAM. Services managed via PM2: web-app (port 3000), api-server (port 3001), background-worker. Nginx reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt SSL. Domain: example-project.dev.",
    "## User Authentication\nImplemented OAuth2 with Google and GitHub providers. Session management uses httpOnly cookies with 7-day expiry. Added rate limiting on auth endpoints: 5 attempts per minute per IP.",
    "## Database Design\nPostgreSQL for structured data, SQLite for local caches. Main tables: users, projects, metrics, events. Added composite indexes on (project_id, created_at) for time-range queries. Migration system using knex.",
    "## API Design Decisions\nREST for CRUD operations, WebSocket for real-time updates. Chose tRPC over GraphQL for type safety without schema overhead. Rate limiting: 100 req/min for authenticated users, 20 for anonymous.",
    "## Working Style Notes\nTeam prefers async communication. Stand-ups are text-based in Slack. Code reviews required for all PRs, 24-hour SLA. Deploy on merge to main. Feature flags for gradual rollout.",
    "## Competitor Analysis\nMain competitor raised $15M Series A. Their product is slide-based presentations — static, not interactive. Our differentiator is spatial depth: click to explore, not just scroll. Second competitor focuses on investor updates only.",
    "## Data Visualization\nAdded chart components: line, bar, sparkline, gauge, KPI card. Charts use D3 internally but expose a declarative API. Auto-scaling axes, responsive sizing, dark mode support. Animations via Framer Motion.",
    "## Performance Optimization\nLighthouse score went from 62 to 94. Key changes: lazy-loaded routes, image optimization via sharp, tree-shaking unused lodash methods, moved to dynamic imports for heavy components. Build time: 45s → 18s.",
    "## Bug Fixes — Week 2\nFixed memory leak in WebSocket reconnection handler. The event listener wasn't being cleaned up on unmount. Also fixed timezone display bug — was showing UTC instead of user's local time in event cards.",
    "## Deployment Pipeline\nGitHub Actions: lint → test → build → deploy. Staging environment mirrors production. Blue-green deployment with health checks. Rollback is one-click via PM2 ecosystem file.",
    "## Security Audit\nRan npm audit — 3 moderate vulnerabilities in transitive deps, all patched. Added Content-Security-Policy headers. Implemented CSRF tokens for form submissions. Reviewed and tightened CORS origins.",
    "## Project Beta — Entity System\nBuilt an entity resolution engine for matching records across data sources. Uses fuzzy string matching with Levenshtein distance and phonetic encoding. Temporal versioning stores full history of each entity.",
    "## Memory System Design\nDesigned a tiered memory architecture: hot cache (last 24h, full detail), warm store (last 30 days, compressed), cold archive (older, summarized). Automatic promotion/demotion based on access frequency.",
    "## NPM Package Development\nPublished the entity resolver as a standalone npm package. Zero dependencies, ESM-only, TypeScript declarations included. Wrote 45 tests covering edge cases. Bundle size: 12KB gzipped.",
    "## Landing Page\nBuilt with Next.js static export. Hero section with animated demo. Three pricing tiers: free (3 projects), pro ($29/mo), enterprise (custom). Email capture for early access — 47 signups in first week.",
    "## Monitoring and Alerts\nSet up Grafana dashboards for API latency, error rates, and memory usage. Alert thresholds: p99 latency > 500ms, error rate > 1%, memory > 80%. Notifications via Slack webhook.",
    "## User Feedback — Round 1\nFirst 5 beta testers reported: navigation is intuitive, loading is fast, but they want collaborative editing and commenting. Export to PDF requested by 3 of 5. Dark mode works well.",
    "## Calendar Integration\nAdded Google Calendar sync via OAuth2. Events display inline in the project timeline. Supports recurring events, reminders at 15min and 1hr. Bi-directional sync with 5-minute polling.",
    "## Email Notifications\nSendGrid integration for transactional email. Templates: welcome, weekly digest, alert notification, password reset. Unsubscribe handling with per-category preferences. Delivery rate: 99.2%.",
    "## Partner Context\nTeam member Sarah handles design and user research. Prefers Figma for mockups, async feedback via Loom videos. Timezone: PST. Usually available 10am-6pm. Likes direct communication, dislikes unnecessary meetings.",
    "## Strategic Planning — Q1\nFocus areas: ship collaborative features (collab editor, comments), improve onboarding (guided tour, templates), start content marketing (blog, social). Revenue target: 50 paying users by end of Q1.",
    "## Technical Debt\nIdentified 3 areas: (1) auth module needs refactoring — grew organically, now 800 lines in one file, (2) test coverage at 43% — target 70%, (3) API response formats inconsistent across endpoints.",
    "## TV Integration\nAdded casting to smart TV for presentation mode. Uses DIAL protocol for discovery, WebSocket for control. Supports Samsung and LG. Known issue: Sony TVs disconnect after 30 minutes of inactivity.",
    "## Weather Integration\nAdded weather widget for event planning. Uses Open-Meteo API (free, no key needed). Shows forecast for event location and date. Accuracy decreases beyond 7 days — show confidence indicator.",
    "## Accessibility Improvements\nAdded ARIA labels to all interactive elements. Keyboard navigation for the spatial grid. Screen reader announcements for state changes. Color contrast meets WCAG AA. Focus indicators visible on all elements.",
    "## Mobile Responsive Design\nRedesigned navigation for mobile: bottom tab bar instead of sidebar. Cards stack vertically with swipe-to-navigate. Touch targets minimum 44px. Tested on iPhone SE, Pixel 6, iPad Mini.",
    "## Background Jobs\nBull queue for async processing: PDF generation, email sending, data imports. Redis for job storage. Worker runs in separate PM2 process. Retry policy: 3 attempts with exponential backoff.",
    "## Documentation\nWrote API docs with Swagger/OpenAPI. User guide with screenshots and GIFs. Architecture decision records (ADRs) for major choices. README covers setup, development, and deployment.",
    "## Week 3 Review\nShipped: auth, data viz, deployment pipeline, monitoring. In progress: collaboration features, mobile responsive. Blocked: PDF export needs puppeteer, which requires more RAM than current VPS. Considering upgrade to 8GB.",
    "## Embedding Experiments\nTested sentence embedding models: BGE-small (384d, fast), GTE-large (1024d, accurate), E5-mistral (4096d, expensive). BGE-small is best for our use case — sub-second encoding, cosine similarity correlates well with semantic relatedness.",
    "## Analytics Dashboard\nBuilt internal analytics: daily active users, feature usage heatmap, session duration distribution, error log viewer. Data stored in ClickHouse for fast aggregation. Dashboard updates every 5 minutes.",
    "## Version Control Practices\nConventional commits enforced via commitlint. Semantic versioning for the npm package. Changelog auto-generated from commits. Branch strategy: main (production), develop (staging), feature/* (WIP).",
    "## Cost Analysis\nMonthly infrastructure: VPS $24, domain $12/yr, SendGrid free tier (100/day), monitoring free tier. Total: ~$30/mo. Revenue needed to break even: 2 pro subscribers. Current burn rate is sustainable.",
    "## Freycoin Integration\nAdded cryptocurrency tracking as a data connector. Fetches block data, transaction history, address balances via public API. Rate-limited to 5 req/sec. Retry logic handles intermittent 429s.",
    "## Team Sync — Week 4\nSarah presented new onboarding flow mockups. Three-step wizard: (1) name your project, (2) import data or use template, (3) invite collaborators. Estimated 2 days to implement. Approved to start next sprint.",
    "## Search Implementation\nFull-text search using SQLite FTS5. Indexes: project titles, card content, user names. Fuzzy matching with trigram similarity. Results ranked by relevance × recency. Sub-100ms for up to 10K documents.",
    "## Error Handling Strategy\nGlobal error boundary in React catches rendering errors. API errors return structured JSON with error codes. Sentry integration for production error tracking. Custom 404 and 500 pages with helpful messages.",
    "## Caching Strategy\nThree layers: browser cache (static assets, 1yr), CDN (API responses, 5min), server cache (Redis, computed values, 1hr). Cache invalidation on write. ETags for conditional requests. Cache hit rate: 78%.",
    "## Open Source Contribution\nUpstream PR to sentence-transformers fixing batch encoding memory leak. Also contributed docs fix to scipy DCT function. Both merged. Good for visibility and community building.",
    "## Monthly Retrospective\nWhat went well: shipped core product fast, good test coverage, monitoring from day 1. What didn't: underestimated mobile complexity, PDF export still blocked. Action items: upgrade VPS, start user interviews.",
    "## Signal Processing Notes\nDCT concentrates energy in low-frequency coefficients for most natural signals. Truncating high frequencies is lossy but degrades uniformly — no hard cutoff. SVD is optimal for variance but lacks temporal interpretation.",
    "## Compression Benchmarks\nTested DCT vs SVD on embedding matrices. SVD wins on raw reconstruction quality. DCT wins on storage efficiency and interpretability. Hybrid approach: SVD for retrieval, DCT for dynamics tracking.",
    "## Access Pattern Analysis\nLogged memory access for 2 weeks. Most accessed: product architecture (34 queries), deployment procedures (28), API reference (22). Least accessed: initial setup notes (2), early brainstorming (1).",
    "## Reconsolidation Engine\nBuilt access-driven frequency promotion. Amplify frequently-accessed embeddings before DCT — shifts their energy to low-frequency bands where it survives truncation. Result: +0.03 similarity for high-access memories.",
    "## Knowledge vs Conversations\nKey insight: compress the knowledge, not the raw dialogue. Conversations are the medium — they should fade naturally. Memory files (distilled decisions, lessons, facts) are what matters for compression.",
    "## Field Tracking\nAutomatic telemetry captures every reconsolidation: per-memory similarity deltas, access energy, frequency band classification. Enables longitudinal analysis of how memories drift through frequency space.",
    "## Three-Tier Memory Model\nEmergent structure from DCT + access promotion: (1) consolidated-into-being (low freq, automatic), (2) sharp-and-available (promoted specifics), (3) offloaded (known-recoverable, legitimately demoted).",
    "## Week 5 Status\nAll major features shipped. 12 beta users, 3 converted to paid. Infrastructure stable. Next focus: content marketing and user interviews. Considering hiring a part-time marketing contractor.",
    "## Lessons Learned\nStart with monitoring, not add it later. Test on real data early. Mobile is always harder than expected. Users care about collaboration more than features. Ship weekly, learn daily."
